# Repos

Application displays tables with information about repos of user, which are placed in HTML file.

I used [API](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/) from Gâ€‹ithub

Each repo has information about:

- name of repository
- description of repository
- date of last update
- url to repository

# Installation and usage

```shell
yarn install

# Run build
yarn buil

# Run start
yarn start

#Open http://localhost:8080/
```
